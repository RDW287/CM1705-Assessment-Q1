# CM1705-Assessment-Q1
Answer to Question 1 of Component 2 of the CM1705 Assessment

Version Control aids developers in managing and tracking any changes to files, this allows teams or individuals to experiment with multiple versions of documents/code while keeping the original, go back to previous versions of needed or merge documents/code together and identify clashes between them.
 
A version control system such as Git/Github allows for repositories to be created which is the equivalent to a "primary folder". From this, a "commit" can be made which saves the file as a version of the repository. A "pull" can then be made which takes the latest version of the files on github. Finally a "push" can be done which updates the repository with the latest files.
This differs from a basic version control system which may include naming files as: "doc_version2.txt", "document_04_05_22.txt" or "document_final.txt". This may work on small projects however as the scale increases it can become increasingly difficult to track.
